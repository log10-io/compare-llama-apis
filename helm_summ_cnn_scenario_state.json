The problem with that is a decent chunk of Arsenal\u2019s supporters feel he doesn\u2019t deserve much. That became obvious on Thursday, when one prominent fan called for the removal of a Fabregas banner from the Ken Friar Bridge. Cesc Fabregas returns to Arsenal on Sunday and Arsene Wenger hopes fans will give him a good reception . Wenger wants 'respect' for the club's former players and counts Fabregas as a man who deserves that . Gunners fans offer their good luck to Fabregas in 2011, but the reception is likely to be more frosty this time . Extreme, perhaps, but this is an emotive issue which continues to bubble away at the club where Fabregas built his career, not least because the circumstances behind his summer move from Barcelona to Chelsea are still as clear as mud. Any clarity, it seems, will have to wait. Wenger was at his cryptic best on Thursday when asked if it was his call to not take up an option he had to re-sign the player, saying: \u2018We will have to discuss that one day. With all the terms.\u2019 When pressed on whether it was his decision, he added: \u2018It\u2019s not as clean as that.

Whatever, it would be ambitious for Fabregas to expect an overwhelmingly positive reception on Sunday. The midfielder set up Diego Costa to seal a 2-0 victory for Chelsea against Arsenal earlier this season . Certainly, there was already a degree of disappointment within the club about how their relationship with the player ended when he left in 2011. But Wenger said: \u2018I want every player to be respected, and Cesc Fabregas when he comes to the Emirates on Sunday, (I want him) to be respected like he deserves.\u2019 Wenger added: \u2018The regret I have is that he wanted to leave here. This club and myself had a very positive influence on Cesc\u2019s life, so I would be a bit uncomfortable to have to justify today why he is not here.\u2019 When he returns, it will be as a key part of the champions-elect and under a manager in Jose Mourinho who has won seven and drawn five of his 12 meetings with Wenger. That clash, in itself, is a fascinating sub-plot to this fixture between the top and second-placed teams in the Barclays Premier League.

Royal Mail has stepped up the amount of junk mail it stuffs through our doors since it was sold off by the Government, new figures show. More than 8.7million flyers were delivered by the company in the year following its privatisation \u2013 sparking fears that it risks becoming a \u2018leaflet distributor\u2019. In the 12 months after privatisation, postmen pushed almost 50,000 more leaflets and advertising letters through our doors every single day, compared to the previous year. It means almost 3.2bn items of \u2018unaddressed\u2019 junk mail were delivered in just one year \u2013 almost double the 1.7bn delivered annually five years ago. These figures do not even include the vast quantities of \u2018addressed\u2019 junk mail also delivered, which have the names of occupants on the envelope. The rise in unsolicited mail has proved lucrative for Royal Mail, which is struggling from increased competition in the parcels market and a fall in the number of ordinary letters being posted. Revenue from \u2018marketing mail\u2019 \u2013 addressed and unaddressed \u2013 has soared to \u00a31.1bn a year, earning them \u00a33million a day. Critics last night called for Royal Mail to reduce the amount of \u2018nuisance\u2019 junk mail it delivers or risk becoming a \u2018leaflet distributor\u2019. Royal Mail admitted junk Mail had become an \u2018important component\u2019 of its business, and insisted many households found advertising flyers \u2018useful\u2019. But much of unwanted junk mail is never opened and ends up being thrown straight into the bin \u2013 causing an environmental headache. While some households recycle takeaway menus and pamphlets, many tonnes of junk mail end up in landfill \u2013 costing councils tens of millions of pounds to dispose of. A spokesman for the Local Government Association said: \u2018Junk mail is a blight on the nation\u2019s doormats. \u2018Not only is it a nuisance to pick up and throw away, it adds thousands of tonnes to the waste councils have to pick up creating additional costs for tax payers. \u2018Royal Mail and its direct marketing clients have to do far more to reduce the torrent of junk mail.\u2019 Robert Rijkhoff, of the Stop Junk Mail campaign, said marketing mail was \u2018the worst form of advertising\u2019 because it was foisted upon households without their consent. He said: \u2018Royal Mail needs to make money but, if they deliver more and more junk mail as a source of income, in the long term I am not sure it is a sustainable business. \u2018Royal Mail is delivering less and less letters. They are risking that, in time, they will become a leaflet distributor.\u2019 Critics claim that some junk mail contain scams sent by fraudsters from overseas. Critics said the company was running the risk of being labelled a 'leaflet distributor' with fewer letters being posted every year . In 2011, the National Fraud Authority claimed the Royal Mail logo was seen by some victims as a stamp of legitimacy, making the scammers appear more trustworthy.

          "text": "(CNN)Two years ago, the storied Boston Marathon ended in terror and altered the lives of runners, spectators and those who tried to come to their rescue. Just last week, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was convicted on 30 charges related to the bombings at the race and the dramatic violence that dragged out for days afterward. The jury will begin deliberating his punishment next week. The death penalty is on the table. Dzhokhar and his brother Tamerlan, who was killed in a shootout with police, were intent on terrorizing not just Bostonians, but all Americans, prosecutors said. But the Tsarnaevs were not on the minds of most people in Boston on Wednesday. The injured victims and those who lost their lives were spoken of with reverence in somber ceremonies. Relatives of 8-year-old Martin Richard, the attack's youngest victim, and the family of Krystle Campbell stood with Gov. Charlie Baker and Mayor Martin Walsh. Bagpipes played and banners whipped in the wind on Boylston Street, the Boston Globe reported. Boston University graduate student Lingzi Lu also was killed in one of the two horrific blasts that brought chaos to the competitors and spectators near the race's finish line on April 15, 2013. Who were the victims? Many bombing survivors were in the crowd for Wednesday's events, the newspaper said. They wore white, blue and yellow pins celebrating \"One Boston Day,\" which was created to recognize acts of valor and to encourage kindness among Bostonians. Many there and those who couldn't observe the day in person tweeted their respect and memories using #BostonDay. The marathon historically happens on a Monday. This year, runners will take on the 26.2 mile challenge April 20. \"I think today will always be a little emotional for me -- Marathon Monday is my favorite day of the year, and will continue to be, despite these tragedies,\" Boston resident Lindsey Berkowitz told CNN. \"I have so much respect and support for all of the survivors, and hope the city continues to come together on this day to embrace the strength and resilience of Boston, and the love we all have for this great city.\" Melanie DiVasta was working just a mile from the finish line in 2013 when one of the bombs set by the Tsarnaevs exploded. Several of her friends were waiting at the finish line. They were unharmed. \"It was just an overwhelming feeling of shock to start hearing about it and seeing images,\" DiVasta said. \"You couldn't help but cry and just ask why.\" What's next for Dzhokhar Tsarnaev? CNN's Jareen Imam contributed to this report."

Just last week, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was convicted on 30 charges related to the bombings at the race and the dramatic violence that dragged out for days afterward. The jury will begin deliberating his punishment next week. The death penalty is on the table. Dzhokhar and his brother Tamerlan, who was killed in a shootout with police, were intent on terrorizing not just Bostonians, but all Americans, prosecutors said. But the Tsarnaevs were not on the minds of most people in Boston on Wednesday. The injured victims and those who lost their lives were spoken of with reverence in somber ceremonies. Relatives of 8-year-old Martin Richard, the attack's youngest victim, and the family of Krystle Campbell stood with Gov. Charlie Baker and Mayor Martin Walsh. Bagpipes played and banners whipped in the wind on Boylston Street, the Boston Globe reported. Boston University graduate student Lingzi Lu also was killed in one of the two horrific blasts that brought chaos to the competitors and spectators near the race's finish line on April 15, 2013. Who were the victims? Many bombing survivors were in the crowd for Wednesday's events, the newspaper said. They wore white, blue and yellow pins celebrating \"One Boston Day,\" which was created to recognize acts of valor and to encourage kindness among Bostonians. Many there and those who couldn't observe the day in person tweeted their respect and memories using #BostonDay. The marathon historically happens on a Monday. This year, runners will take on the 26.2 mile challenge April 20. \"I think today will always be a little emotional for me -- Marathon Monday is my favorite day of the year, and will continue to be, despite these tragedies,\" Boston resident Lindsey Berkowitz told CNN. \"I have so much respect and support for all of the survivors, and hope the city continues to come together on this day to embrace the strength and resilience of Boston, and the love we all have for this great city.\" Melanie DiVasta was working just a mile from the finish line in 2013 when one of the bombs set by the Tsarnaevs exploded. Several of her friends were waiting at the finish line. They were unharmed. \"It was just an overwhelming feeling of shock to start hearing about it and seeing images,\" DiVasta said. \"You couldn't help but cry and just ask why.\" What's next for Dzhokhar Tsarnaev? CNN's Jareen Imam contributed to this report.\n\nSummarize the above article in 3 sentences.",

Protesters fired gunshots and torched a local electoral office in Nigeria's oil-rich Rivers state as they marched to protest national elections held to elect Nigeria's next President. \"There's been so much violence in Rivers state that it's just not tenable,\" said Lai Mohammed, spokesman for the main opposition party, the All Peoples Congress. The All Peoples Congress says the vote has been rigged, voters intimidated and demanded that the elections held in Rivers state be canceled. The ruling party, the Peoples Democratic Party, refutes the accusation, saying the election was \"credible and the result reflects the overwhelming wish of the people of Rivers state to support President Goodluck Jonathan.\" Heavy rain eventually forced the protesters home, but there are fears that it will take more than rain to stop further protests and violence. \"We are concerned by what seems to be happening,\" said Attahiru Jega, Nigeria's election chairman, about events in Rivers state. Nigeria has just held what are thought to be the closest elections since a return to democracy in 1999 after decades of military rule. The two main candidates are incumbent President Goodluck Jonathan and retired general Muhammedu Buhari. What is at stake in the protests in Rivers state is not whether Nigeria can hold an election, but can it hold a \"close\" election. Voting is now over and the results are being counted. Jega says the final result will likely be announced within 48 hours. The fear is that the results may not be accepted by whomever loses. And if the opposition believes it has been rigged out of victory by the ruling party, then the protests in Rivers state could spread to northern Nigeria. Over 800 people were killed in post-election violence across the north after the 2011 elections were thought to be illegitimate. And so both candidates have taken to social media to call for calm. \"I want to urge all Nigerians to also wait patiently for the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, to collate and announce results,\" stated Jonathan on his Facebook account. \"Fellow Nigerians, I urge you to exercise patience and vigilance as we wait for all results to be announced,\" said Buhari on Twitter."

          "text": "Former PM Tony Blair was given an award for his 'global legacy' by Save the Children last year . Save the Children has apologised over its decision to give Tony Blair an award for his 'global legacy' after a furious public backlash. Justin Forsyth, the charity's chief executive, said he was 'very sorry' for those upset by the decision, but insisted it was only meant to mark his work in Africa and not his entire time in Number 10. Mr Forsyth, a former Downing Street aide, admitted it would have been 'wrong' to give an award to the former PM for his political legacy rather than for his work on international aid. Mr Blair was handed an award for spending billions of taxpayers' money on foreign aid at a star-studded ceremony in New York last year. The former PM, who set Britain on course towards spending 0.7 per cent of GDP on overseas aid, was given the charity's Global Legacy Award in recognition of his leadership in international development. But the award sparked widespread fury when it was announced in November. More than 100,000 people signed an online petition calling for the award to be rescinded and around 500 Saved the Children staff members have reportedly backed a similar petition. Questioned about the award on the BBC's Today programme this morning, Mr Forsyth said: 'I know that many of our supporters and volunteers were very upset and our staff, several of our staff too, and I'm very sorry for that.' He said the decision had been made by the British charity's 'sister organisation' in the US and insisted the award was only for his Africa work. Mr Forsyth said: 'Yes, it was a global legacy award. It was called that. But actually it was an award very, very specifically for Tony Blair's efforts on Africa at two G8 summits at Birmingham and Gleneagles, not his wider legacy. 'And if it had been for his wider legacy I think it would be wrong, but it was for something quite specific that helped Africa and children. 'I'm sorry it's upset so many people. It's not really what we do at Save the Children. What we're really doing is on the ground in Syria with the Ebola treatment centre in Sierra Leone \u2013 that's the work we do. 'This has been really an unnecessary distraction. I do apologise to those people that it's upset.' Justin Forsyth (left), the charity's chief executive pictured in Lebanon with Samantha Cameron, said he was 'very sorry' for those upset by the decision to honour Tony Blair . Mr Blair was handed the award for spending billions of public money on foreign aid at a star-studded ceremony in New York last year - also attended by Mike Bezos (centre left), Dakota Fanning (centre right), and Nicholas Kristo (right) Mr Forsyth admitted the row had 'in part' damaged the charity in eyes of some staff but expressed hope people would accept organisations 'make mistakes'.

Save the Children has apologised over its decision to give Tony Blair an award for his 'global legacy' after a furious public backlash. Justin Forsyth, the charity's chief executive, said he was 'very sorry' for those upset by the decision, but insisted it was only meant to mark his work in Africa and not his entire time in Number 10. Mr Forsyth, a former Downing Street aide, admitted it would have been 'wrong' to give an award to the former PM for his political legacy rather than for his work on international aid. Mr Blair was handed an award for spending billions of taxpayers' money on foreign aid at a star-studded ceremony in New York last year. The former PM, who set Britain on course towards spending 0.7 per cent of GDP on overseas aid, was given the charity's Global Legacy Award in recognition of his leadership in international development. But the award sparked widespread fury when it was announced in November. More than 100,000 people signed an online petition calling for the award to be rescinded and around 500 Saved the Children staff members have reportedly backed a similar petition. Questioned about the award on the BBC's Today programme this morning, Mr Forsyth said: 'I know that many of our supporters and volunteers were very upset and our staff, several of our staff too, and I'm very sorry for that.' He said the decision had been made by the British charity's 'sister organisation' in the US and insisted the award was only for his Africa work. Mr Forsyth said: 'Yes, it was a global legacy award. It was called that. But actually it was an award very, very specifically for Tony Blair's efforts on Africa at two G8 summits at Birmingham and Gleneagles, not his wider legacy. 'And if it had been for his wider legacy I think it would be wrong, but it was for something quite specific that helped Africa and children. 'I'm sorry it's upset so many people. It's not really what we do at Save the Children. What we're really doing is on the ground in Syria with the Ebola treatment centre in Sierra Leone \u2013 that's the work we do. 'This has been really an unnecessary distraction. I do apologise to those people that it's upset.' Justin Forsyth (left), the charity's chief executive pictured in Lebanon with Samantha Cameron, said he was 'very sorry' for those upset by the decision to honour Tony Blair . Mr Blair was handed the award for spending billions of public money on foreign aid at a star-studded ceremony in New York last year - also attended by Mike Bezos (centre left), Dakota Fanning (centre right), and Nicholas Kristo (right) Mr Forsyth admitted the row had 'in part' damaged the charity in eyes of some staff but expressed hope people would accept organisations 'make mistakes'. Mr Forsyth was recruited to Number 10 by Mr Blair to help with work on poverty and\n\nSummarize the above article in 3 sentences.",

While his praise for the designers was greeted with laughter by the audience, Elton went on to add: 'Listen, the band have been wearing Dolce & Gabbana, I love Dolce & Gabbana clothes.' Sir Elton announced last week that he would boycott the brand after designer Domenico Dolce criticised IVF, saying: 'You are born and you have a father and mother. At least it should be like that.

Responding to Walker's claims that he'd 'absolutely' cancel or 'disown' a deal with Iran on 'day one' if elected to higher office, Obama told NPR Morning Edition host Steve Inskeep that such an approach 'would be foolish.' 'And, you know, perhaps Mr. Walker, after he's taken some time to bone up on foreign policy, will feel the same way,' the president added. Walker fired back at Obama on Twitter, saying, 'Americans would be better served by a President who spent more time working with governors & Congress rather than attacking them.' Scroll down for video . Foolish: In an interview with NPR, Obama said likely Republican presidential candidate Scott Walker may change his 'foolish' position on a deal with Iran 'after he's taken some time to bone up on foreign policy' Obama's jab at Walker departed from the White House's general strategy of staying out of the race to replace the sitting president, who is prohibited by the Constitution from seeking another term . Obama's jab at Walker, the governor of Wisconsin, departed from the White House's general strategy of staying out of the race to replace the sitting president, who is prohibited by the Constitution from seeking another term. The current administration has been more willing to weigh in, however, when a presumed Republican candidate threatens to dismantle one of the president's prized domestic or foreign policies, which, in the case of Walker, was the nuclear arrangement with Iran. 'I am confident that any president who gets elected will be knowledgeable enough about foreign policy and knowledgeable enough about the traditions and precedents of presidential power that they won't start calling to question the capacity of the executive branch of the United States to enter into agreements with other countries,' Obama told Inskeep during their Monday afternoon chat following the NPR host's invocation of Walker's past comments. 'If that starts being questioned, that's going to be a problem for our friends and that's going to embolden our enemies.' Continuing, Obama said, that 'would be a foolish approach to take' and slammed Walker. A cadre of probable Republican presidential contenders have spoken out against the Obama administration's laboriously negotiated pact with Iran to stunt the growth of the country's program. Walker is the only one to say he would not honor his predecessor's deal with Iran and the international community if elevated to presidency, however. 'If I ultimately choose to run, and if I\u2019m honored to be elected by the people of this country, I will pull back on that on January 20, 2017, because the last thing \u2014 not just for the region but for this world \u2014 we need is a nuclear-armed Iran,' he told radio host Charlie Sykes last week.

Or, would you rather shell your hard-earned savings on a pink handbag? That is exactly what retailer Vestiaire Collective is hoping for, as they put a Hermes bag on sale for a cool \u00a3140,000 on their site. Is this Britain's most expensive handbag? A sade-to-measure pink croc Hermes Birkin bag embellished with rubies has gone on sale for \u00a3140,000 . So what do you get for your money? The made-to-measure pink croc Hermes Birkin bag comes embellished with rubies. The rare tote is so exclusive that it can't even be brought in store and experts say it's an extremely good investment. Fanny Moizant, Vestiaire Collective's Brand Communications Director and Head of UK, said: 'Hermes Birkin bags have come to symbolise the epitome of quality, the materials and the impeccable French craftsmanship are second to none. 'The brand has a strong heritage with a controlled supply, which makes it highly desirable for stylish women. This aspirational identity has developed into a strong social status symbol. The limited supply and production of rare colours and skin have made these bags must-have collectors items resulting in an increased value over time, unlike cars, which are known to depreciate in value after leaving the showroom.'

Or, would you rather shell your hard-earned savings on a pink handbag? That is exactly what retailer Vestiaire Collective is hoping for, as they put a Hermes bag on sale for a cool \u00a3140,000 on their site. Is this Britain's most expensive handbag? A sade-to-measure pink croc Hermes Birkin bag embellished with rubies has gone on sale for \u00a3140,000 . So what do you get for your money? The made-to-measure pink croc Hermes Birkin bag comes embellished with rubies. The rare tote is so exclusive that it can't even be brought in store and experts say it's an extremely good investment. Fanny Moizant, Vestiaire Collective's Brand Communications Director and Head of UK, said: 'Hermes Birkin bags have come to symbolise the epitome of quality, the materials and the impeccable French craftsmanship are second to none. 'The brand has a strong heritage with a controlled supply, which makes it highly desirable for stylish women. This aspirational identity has developed into a strong social status symbol. The limited supply and production of rare colours and skin have made these bags must-have collectors items resulting in an increased value over time, unlike cars, which are known to depreciate in value after leaving the showroom.'

Ross was arrested on suspicion of murder and appeared before South Tyneside Magistrates' Court yesterday where no plea was taken and the case was referred to a crown court. Melissa Liddle, 23, (left) was found dead at the home she shared with her boyfriend Anthony Ross (right) and her sons on Mother's Day. Ross was arrested and charged with her murder and appeared at court yesterday . Officers and paramedics were called to her home at about 8.10pm on Mother's Day but she was pronounced dead at the scene. A 48-year-old was originally arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender but police have said he faces no further action. Miss Liddle, who had two sons aged five and seven months and was a volunteer for St John's Ambulance, has been described as a 'loving and caring person'. Her step cousin, Nikki Keighley, 25, set up an online fundraising page to help support the family yesterday and it has already raised \u00a33,750. Paramedics were called to Melissa Liddle's home at 8.10pm on Sunday but she was pronounced dead . Ms Keighley said: 'I was speaking to my uncle and I asked him if he wouldn't mind if I set something up. 'He is still distraught and said yes without really thinking much about it. I didn't think it would go this big. 'With the kids being so young and will need to be looked after until they are 18 I thought it was important for them to have some support. 'Hopefully this will mean they can do some nice things that will take their minds off losing their mum. 'My uncle said to me that he was proud of me for doing this because it reminded him of Melissa as this would be something that she would of done.' She added: 'The family are so proud and they would like to thank everyone who has donated and will thank them properly at the right time. 'When something like this happens, you worry about funeral costs and buying things that the kids need. 'The donations have lifted a weight off the family's shoulders and it's one less thing for them to worry about. It's amazing how the community comes together at times like this. 'It isn't just the family who are devastated it is also other young mothers who knew her from the area. It has affected everyone. 'The family are still distraught. It's like it isn't real. They are taking each day as it comes.' The case was referred to Newcastle Crown Court and Ross was remanded in custody until the next hearing on March 19.

The Arsenal manager says that United defender Jonny Evans - who will be banned for the FA Cup quarter final against Arsenal on Monday - cannot expect any mercy in the modern age of global TV scrutiny. However, Wenger says the practice was more prevalent in former days when he played for RC Strasbourg in France, but that the lack of TV coverage meant it used to be less of an issue. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger reveals he was spat at while playing football in the French leagues . Jonny Evans appears to launch spit in the direction of the Newcastle United striker, who then retaliates . Wenger said: 'Today the television makes it worse. I've been subject personally to spitting. Maybe my tackle was not good enough. At the time nobody spoke about it. 'When I played in France, it happened before but you didn't see it on television. When you see it on television it of course makes it worse. I was angry (when it happened) but I could control myself.' Asked whether spitting deserved a six-game ban, Wenger said: 'I applied the sentence myself. I don't know the rules well enough. It is rules. We have to respect the rules. They have to apply the rules. Evans and Papiss Cisse clash near the half-way line at St James' Park following the unpleasant exchange . Manchester United defender Evans has received a six-match ban from the FA after the ugly incident . Cisse already served a three-match ban for violent conduct this season after elbowing Everton\u2019s Seamus Coleman in December. As a result, the Newcastle striker gets an additional one-match suspension after admitting his guilt, while Evans gets six. But Wenger insisted that the likes of Evans and Papiss Cisse have to accept that their actions will incur punishments now that all games are scrutinised by millions of viewers worldwide. 'We have to pay a price for that. We are popular. We are watched all over the world. It gives us some responsibility as well. When you do not live up to it, you have to pay for it. How much it (the punishment) is, I do not care but you cannot say: 'Ok, it's nothing' when you see in on television. When little boys are watching the game, if your boy says to you: 'Is that right?' You cannot say: 'Yes.' 'We have to accept that. There are cameras everywhere, that means we are spied on always basically, from morning until night, and that's a little bit less freedom to go over the line sometimes. 'It's good, it's good. You know it's like now the doping story that is coming out in cycling now. Even if it's 10 years later, 15 years later, people will be less inclined to do it today because they think: 'Oh, for the rest of my life that could come out, so I won't do it.'"

The improving Germans, who have recovered after a dismal first half to the domestic season that saw them anchored in last place as recently as last month in the Bundesliga, have kept a clean sheet in their last three league games, including a 0-0 draw against Cologne on the weekend. With Neven Subotic and Mats Hummels back fit in central defence, along with full backs Marcel Schmelzer and Lukasz Piszczek, Dortmund's defence has been as solid as it has been all season. Jurgen Klopp talks to his Dortmund players during a training session ahead of the second leg with Juventus . (Left to right): Adrian Ramos, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Sokratis Papastathopoulos and Marco Reus . The Dortmund squad are put through their paces in training ahead of the crucial game against Juventus . Aubameyang (left) talks with Reus (right) as the Dortmund pair limber up in training with some leg stretches . '(Against Cologne) we played another game without letting in a goal and that is something we can build on,' Klopp told reporters. 'We want to advance to the quarter-finals and we can do this.' Dortmund boast a fine record at home in Europe having won 11 of their last 14 Champions League games at the Westfalenstadion. But in order to book a spot in the last eight they have to snap a losing run at home against Juventus, having lost all three previous encounters against the Italians in Dortmund. Klopp will be counting on goals from Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, who has scored five in his last seven outings and in-form Marco Reus, who has struck five times in eight games. Marco Reus cancelled out Carlos Tevez's opener before Alvaro Morata scored a 42nd-minute winner . Juventus are flying high in Serie A, edging closer to the Italian title with their first triumph away from home in over two months at Palermo, opening up a 14-point lead. 'One less win needed to win the league,' Juventus manager Massimiliano Allegri said, knowing he will now need to shift his focus to Dortmund and their attacking game. 'We will need to take the lead there, maybe score more than one goal,' said the coach. They will, however, be without influential playmaker Andrea Pirlo who has yet to fully recover from a thigh injury suffered in the first leg. 'He has made good progress but not enough to be in Dortmund,' the club said in a statement. Klopp knows that his side will have to be at their absolute best to overcome high-flying Serie A giants Juve .

No, we don't have to call them thugs.\" \"Just call them n-----s. Just call them n-----s,\" he said. \"No, we don't have to call them by names such as that.\" The Rev. Jamal Bryant drew the same comparison Wednesday morning on CNN. The President and the mayor are wrong, he said. \"These are not thugs, these are upset and frustrated children.\" \"It's amazing. You don't call six police officers who kill a man without probable cause 'thugs,' but children who are frustrated and don't have an outlet, you call them 'thugs.' 'Thugs' is the 21st century word for the n-word. And it is repulsive and it is offensive to every person who is a parent trying to raise children interpreting what's taking place in this hour.\" The recent unrest in Baltimore was sparked by the arrest and death of Freddie Gray, who suffered a severe spinal cord injury while in custody. Six officers have been suspended over the incident. Bryant delivered the eulogy at Gray's funeral. What we know, don't know about Freddie Gray's death . Mayor Rawlings-Blake responded Wednesday. \"I wanted to clarify my comments on 'thugs,'\" she wrote Wednesday on Twitter. \"When you speak out of frustration and anger, one can say things in a way that you don't mean.\" She added, \"That night we saw misguided young people who need to be held accountable, but who also need support. And my comments then didn't convey that.\" Kweisi Mfume, Baltimore native and former president of the NAACP, said, \"It's important we not shift the focus into something that has absolutely nothing to do with poverty, despair, hunger, homelessness and a sense of not belonging.\" \"Whether we call them a thug, a law breaker, a juvenile delinquent, it really doesn't matter. What matters is how do we take back our streets. And that's what men have been doing, going around, talking to these young men where they, are in their face, and letting them know, you can't control this community. It is not yours. You can't burn it down. You can't force people out. You can't threaten people,\" he told \"OutFront.\" \"So I understand that, that people want to talk about a word. But I'm more worried about a movement, and it's not necessarily a movement for positive change. It's a movement for negative change right now unless we get it under control.\" Kevin Shird, another Baltimore native and author of \"Lessons of Redemption,\" said \"thug\" is \"not like the n-word in my mind.\" But, he said in a CNN interview, the term has \"been racialized across America, so I can see why people would become offended like that.\" Shird, a former drug dealer, also said he"

Mayor Rawlings-Blake responded Wednesday. \"I wanted to clarify my comments on 'thugs,'\" she wrote Wednesday on Twitter. \"When you speak out of frustration and anger, one can say things in a way that you don't mean.\" She added, \"That night we saw misguided young people who need to be held accountable, but who also need support. And my comments then didn't convey that.\" Kweisi Mfume, Baltimore native and former president of the NAACP, said, \"It's important we not shift the focus into something that has absolutely nothing to do with poverty, despair, hunger, homelessness and a sense of not belonging.\" \"Whether we call them a thug, a law breaker, a juvenile delinquent, it really doesn't matter. What matters is how do we take back our streets. And that's what men have been doing, going around, talking to these young men where they, are in their face, and letting them know, you can't control this community. It is not yours. You can't burn it down. You can't force people out. You can't threaten people,\" he told \"OutFront.\" \"So I understand that, that people want to talk about a word. But I'm more worried about a movement, and it's not necessarily a movement for positive change. It's a movement for negative change right now unless we get it under control.\" Kevin Shird, another Baltimore native and author of \"Lessons of Redemption,\" said \"thug\" is \"not like the n-word in my mind.\" But, he said in a CNN interview, the term has \"been racialized across America, so I can see why people would become offended like that.\" Shird, a former drug dealer, also said he\n\nSummarize the above article in 3 sentences.",

Last week, NASA scientists discussed in very concrete terms the steps to discovering life elsewhere in the universe over the next decade or two. This year is the 20th anniversary of the discovery of a planet around a star like our own sun, 51 Pegasi. Since then, ground-based surveys and NASA's Kepler satellite have discovered nearly 2,000 confirmed \"exoplanets,\" and thousands more candidates await confirmation. Many of these planetary systems are quite unlike our own solar system. Some have large planets like Jupiter that orbit their stars far closer than Mercury, the innermost planet in our solar system. But smaller rocky planets like Earth, though harder to find, appear to be even more abundant. Life on Earth developed in its oceans about a billion years after the planet formed. That suggests that rocky planets with liquid water on their surfaces might also have developed primitive forms of life. Life as we know it is carbon-based and requires liquid water. Astronomers define the \"habitable zone\" around a star as the region within which liquid water can exist on a planet's surface. Any closer to the star, the water will boil into vapor; any farther and the water freezes into ice. Extrapolating from discoveries to date, astronomers estimate there are perhaps 40 billion Earth-like, habitable-zone planets in our Milky Way galaxy alone.

And life that can use radio waves has existed on Earth for only 0.000002% of the planet's history -- 100 years out of 4.5 billion. If the half dozen or so rocky, Earth-like exoplanets now known are similar, the odds of discovering humanlike life on them are about the same as, well, winning your state lottery with one ticket. Of course, if there are 40 billion Earth-like planets out there, the odds improve quite a bit. If they all have histories like the Earth's, there might be 1,000 planets in the Milky Way that could support communicative beings.
